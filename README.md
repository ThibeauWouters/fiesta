`fiesta`: **F**ast **I**nference of **E**lectromagnetic **S**ignals and **T**ransients with j**A**x


**NOTE:** `fiesta` is currently under development -- stay tuned!

## Examples

- `train_Bu2022Ye.py`: Showing how to train a surrogate model for the `Bu2022Ye` kilonova model and use 
it to generate lightcurves. 
- `test_run.py`: An initial test run showing how inference can be done on injected data with `flowMC`. NOTE: This is using an older version of `flowMC`. Install by cloning the `flowMC` version at [this fork](https://github.com/ThibeauWouters/flowMC/tree/fiesta).
